# CM2030_3DSinGame
A 3D browser-based graphics project that implements a SIN wave function.

This project is an example of generative artwork, and creates a pulsating 3D object that looks like 
a water ripple which occurs when a stone is dropped in a pond.

The objects have materials applied to them to make them react to the implemented lights in the scene.

This was one of four mini projects that amounted to my Final submission for CM2030 Graphics Programming

The other projects were:
  
  CM2030_instagramFilter
  CM2030_averageFace
  CM2030_WebcamPiano

This project utilizes JavaScript and the p5.js library to implement a consistent SIN wave function.
